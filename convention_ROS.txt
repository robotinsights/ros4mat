Naming convention
=================

The diverse ROS publisher nodes (the drivers, for instance) are named 
according to these rules:


Package name (created with roscreate-pkg): P_packageName
	ie.: P_sensors, P_communications
	Note: a single package can (and should) contain multiple nodes

Node names at runtime (ros::init parameter): D_nodeName if publisher, S_nodeName if subscriber
	ie.: D_IMU, D_battery, S_matlabTransfer

Message names: M_nodeName_additionalDescription
	ie.: M_battery, M_IMU_acceleration
	Normally, a single message type is allowed per node

Topic names (parameter of NodeHandle.advertise): nodeName/data
	ie.: D_battery/data
	We can also specify a topic nodeName/debug if necessary

cpp filenames: no restrictions aside from no space allowed or non-basic ASCII characters.

Executable names (specified in CMakeLists): E_nodeName
	ie.: E_battery
